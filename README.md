# Linear to Motion

Retrieves issues from the current cycle on [Linear](https://linear.app) and
creates matching tasks in [Motion](https://usemotion.com).

Created using [Smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer).

This took me 30 minutes to learn how to use the tool, 3 hours of iterating on the prompt and
reading API docs, and 30 minutes of cleaning up.

## TODO:

- [ ] Configure the Motion workspace name
- [ ] Configure the email address on linear
- [ ] Set the priority
- [ ] Select an upcoming cycle
- [ ] Don't recreate existing tasks and projects
